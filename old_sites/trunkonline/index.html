          those of you who haven't noticed the plates all over campus, we here 
          at Trunk are putting out our semiannual call for all Tufts students 
          to traipse on down to the <strong><a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/asmap/default.htm#seven" target="_blank">Performance 
          Hangar</a></strong> for the succintly enjoyable bit of game-playing 
          known as our auditions! Held at the beginning of each semester, the 
          Fall '05 try-outs are this Saturday, September 17th. We apoligize for 
          the belatedness of this announcement, but be sure to run down to the 
          Aidekman call board to sign on up for a slot on Saturday (call backs 
          Sunday). If all the spots are filled, call Jess at 973.650.5760 or just 
          show up - we love walk-ins.</font></p>

Leah Trunker reports, &quot;we're scheduled to perform at 1 PM and 3 PM,&quot; so though we're not yet up on the websifete, be sure to come out to support the Somerville Arts Council and keep an eye out for some Trunkers - further details are sure to develop on the ArtBeat website.

          this the official, &quot;Welcome to TrunkOnline!&quot; message. The 
          site, after manymanymany hours in Tufts' beautiful Eaton Computer Lab, 
          is up. It's up, and I like to think it's pretty. Watch out for some 
          broken links while perusing our old scrapbooks (clicking &quot;TRUNK!&quot; won't take you back to this page, like it will from everywhere else). 
          I also wouldn't mind some more content on the photo and alumni pages, 
          but there are finals to study for, you know? You know.</font></p>

          imagine that there will be few updates in the coming months, as I (your 
          illustrious webmaster) head home, without access to all this wonderful 
          technology. So sit tight. Trunk <em>will</em> be performing at Somerville's 
          <a href="http://www.somervilleartscouncil.org/programs/artbeat/" target="_blank">ArtBeat</a> 
          in Davis Square in July, but aside from that, we will all be job-searching 
          (for the grads) and relaxing for a few months. It's all in preparation 
          for another wonderful fall season. Stay tuned.</font></p>
